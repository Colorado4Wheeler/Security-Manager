Security Manager
==========

A plugin for the Indigo home automation system (http://indigodomo.com)

Security Manager monitors devices you specify to see if your house is secure.  The concept is relatively simple, if your device or devices are not in a state that indicates security (i.e., garage door is closed and front door is locked) then the plugin indicates that your house is not secured by toggling its own state on and off.
